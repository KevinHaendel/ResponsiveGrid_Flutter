Responsive Grid Layout and List for Flutter

### Responsive Grid Layout

With `ResponsiveGridRow` and `ResponsiveGridCol` you can get the same behavior of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) Grid System

Give every col the width it shall occupy at every size category assuming the total width is 12
    
```dart
        ResponsiveGridRow(
          children: [
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              lg: 12,
              child: Container(
                height: 100,
                alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
                color: Colors.purple,
                child: Text("lg : 12"),
              ),
            ),
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 3,
              child: Container(
                height: 100,
                alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
                color: Colors.green,
                child: Text("xs : 6 \r\nmd : 3"),
              ),
            ),
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 3,
              child: Container(
                height: 100,
                alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
                color: Colors.orange,
                child: Text("xs : 6 \r\nmd : 3"),
              ),
            ),
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 3,
              child: Container(
                height: 100,
                alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
                color: Colors.red,
                child: Text("xs : 6 \r\nmd : 3"),
              ),
            ),
            ResponsiveGridCol(
              xs: 6,
              md: 3,
              child: Container(
                height: 100,
                alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
                color: Colors.blue,
                child: Text("xs : 6 \r\nmd : 3"),
              ),
            ),
        )

```

### Responsive Grid List

`ResponsiveGridList` works differently in that you only specify a desired width for the items and spacing, and it will decide how many items shall fit in a line, and the width of the item and spacing will change (only small change) to fill the entire width

```dart
    ResponsiveGridList(
        desiredItemWidth: 100,
        minSpacing: 10,
        children: [
          1,
          2,
          3,
          4,
          5,
          6,
          7,
          8,
          9,
          10,
          11,
          12,
          13,
          14,
          15,
          16,
          17,
          18,
          19,
          20
        ].map((i) {
          return Container(
            height: 100,
            alignment: Alignment(0, 0),
            color: Colors.cyan,
            child: Text(i.toString()),
          );
        }).toList()
    )

```

### Utilities

`ResponsiveWidget` and `responsiveValue()`

### Override breakpoints

Add before attach App widget 

```dart
ResponsiveGridBreakpoints.value = ResponsiveGridBreakpoints(
  xs: 600,
  sm: 905, 
  md: 1240,
  lg: 1440,
);
```
